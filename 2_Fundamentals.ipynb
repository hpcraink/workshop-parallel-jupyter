    "In Python, variables (sometimes called names) are always pointers/references to an object (sometimes called value). A variable is defined within a scope and only visible in this scope. The object itselve is stored in global memory and therefore visible outside of the scope it was created in. For this to work, it needs to be passed to another scope (e.g. as parameter of a function call). By assignment, multiple variables may point to the same object. An object is preserved, until the last reference to this object is deleted (e.g. the scope of all variables has exited, or it has been explicitely deleted using the `del` function)\n",

Since instance variables may be defined inside of methods within a class, overloading of methods may remove instance variables (which other methods might erroneously try to access, leading to runtime errors).

All base classes are subject to depth-first, left-to-right search (not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the inheritance hierarchy).\n",

    "\n",
    "Miniconda allows creating an environemtn by loading the binaries. In contrast to `pip install` this reduces the amount of required dependencise, since `pip install` may occasionally build software in the process (e.g. mpi for dask-mpi) and all components required for compilation need to be in the proper form.\n",

    "### Remarks on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter offers good interactivity with your code and data. The source code may be split in several cells and each and every cell executed, changed and re-executed again. Thefreo Jupyter is a good tool to design and experiment with data. In order to enable this functionality, Jupyter requests and allocates ressources from the Cluster's queueing system, even though they are hardly occupying the hardware.\n",
    "Also with regard to Python execution, the possibility to amend code and data in the cells hinders Python's GarbageCollector to clean up state.\n",
    "Therefore it is a good idea to keep to the smallest possible input data set and/or to delete data manually, as soon as it is no longer required:\n",

    "- Use Jupyter during the development process and for documenting/communicating ideas with others\n",
    "- Reduce the data set size as much as possible\n",
    "- Use the `del`-instruction to delete data not longer required\n",
