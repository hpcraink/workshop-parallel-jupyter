    "\n",
    "Here, you will be able to also set another factor for Two-Factor Authorization (2FA), i.e. a one-time-password (OTP) on your mobile phone.\n",
    "In order to start Jupyter, one has to have an existing HOME directory on bwUniClsuter, which requires one successful Login using Secure Shell (SSH): Only upon login, the HOME directory is automatically created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that all of these network accesses (Jupyter, as well as SSH) requires your computer to be located within the IP-range of the Landeshochschulnetz Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg \"BelWue\", i.e. You may need to access from Your University's Virtual Private Network (VPN). Please contact your local compute center's support for details.\n",
